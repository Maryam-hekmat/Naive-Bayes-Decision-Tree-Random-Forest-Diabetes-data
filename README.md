# Naive-Bayes-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Diabetes-data
We came with diabetes data to use several models, including KNN (Of course, I put the codes and analysis in my github in another page and I will put other models in the future by checking the same diabetes data) Now we will check in three other cases  Naive Bayes Decision Tree Random Forest

.....
Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
Accuracy:

Education: 79%

test: 79%

Accuracy: 71%

Recall: 72%

Decision Tree
Accuracy:

Education: 85%

test: 83%

Accuracy: 72%

Recall: 76%

Random Forest
Accuracy:

Education: 90%

test: 85%

Accuracy: 73%

Recall: 78%

analysis
Random Forest: Better performance than other models. Due to the use of a set of decision trees, this model has higher accuracy and is well adapted to the data. The improvement in accuracy, precision and recall shows that this model is suitable for this problem.

Decision Tree: Works well, but not as powerful as Random Forest. This model may be more sensitive to overfitting compared to Random Forest.

Naive Bayes: high speed in training, but accuracy and recall performance is lower than other models. This model is more suitable for very large and fast data, but may give less better results than more complex models.

So, for your diabetes data, Random Forest seems to be more efficient and perform better, due to the ability to use multiple decision trees and combine their results to improve prediction accuracy and stability.
